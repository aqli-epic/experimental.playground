# AQLI's Experimental Playground

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

## Goals of this repository:

* Experiment with new types of visualizations, workstreams. Mix, match, experiment and explore better ways to represent various AQLI datasets.
* We are always experimenting with data and people from time to time request the scripts that went into that process. So, we thought that it's a great idea to share that! 
* In this repository, you'll find all kinds of different work streams that are being experimented with at AQLI. They might not be mainstream as of now, but they might become mainstream in the near future. Even if they don't, that's totally fine because the idea here is to experiment and not worry to much about a finished end product.
